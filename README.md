# blueprints

This repo contains the blueprint diagrams from the AI Infrastructure Alliance.  It includes the blank versions that anyone can feel free to adapt for their own purposes and use in their own literature, as well as different configurations of a canonical stack for machine learning, as well as representations of where different projects and companies fit in the blueprints.
